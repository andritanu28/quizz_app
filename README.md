# quizz_app

Quizzz! is a simple app for elementary school students that them to learn math and science. It asks you a question, you get four choices as an answer, and you keep going until you see how well you do. It features a bunch of questions across a variety of topics. This app were made together by my group for our project. My contribution include designing the logo, build code using android studio, and User Interface using adobe xd.
